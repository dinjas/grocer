<h4> Import Purchase History </h4>

<p>This web app currently works only for gmail, and only if you have receipts from New Seasons in your inbox. Enter in a date in year-month-day format (i.e 2016-11-01) and it will provide you with your purchase history from that date to the present. The records of these purchases will be stored in a database so click on the "Delete your entire purchase history" link above to delete all of it in one fell swoop.</p>

<%= form_tag("/baskets", method: "post") do %>
<div class = "well">
  <%= text_field_tag(:date, "", placeholder: "Enter the earliest date you want to search to in this format (2016-01-01)", class: "form-control") %></br>

  <%= submit_tag("Submit", class: "btn btn-primary") %>
</div>
<% end %>

<p> Depending on how many email receipts you choose to process, this could take a few minutes (I had 250 emails to parse and it took about four minutes to process them).</p>
